# Daily Coding Problem 2019-08-07

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Google._

_Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list._

_The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive._

_Do this in constant space and in one pass._
